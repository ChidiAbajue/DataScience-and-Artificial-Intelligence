This is just a repository containing the notebooks and data sets that I have used during this period in which I have started learning machine learning.
Some of the datasets cannot be found online and some where used during a skill up program at my university at which I learnt data analysis.
I am currently teaching myself Machine and Deep Learning as an advancement to my data analysis skills.
